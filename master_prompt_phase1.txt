MASTER PROMPT FOR PHASE 1 OF MURAL RESTORATION PROJECT

Objective:
Implement a comparative image restoration framework across four approaches (PDE-based, Patch-based, CNN-based, Hybrid) using MuralDH dataset (Mural512 as ground truth) and simulate damage using custom or segmentation-based masks. Each approach is executed in a separate Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). The output (restored/enhanced images) from each approach will be saved in its own dedicated folder.

Technical Requirements:
- Use Python 3.x in Jupyter Notebooks
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch/TensorFlow (for CNN), LPIPS, scikit-image, pandas
- Dataset Path: ./MuralDH/Mural512 for original images
- For synthetic damage, generate masks and apply to ground truth images

    Notebook_4_Deep.ipynb
    Notebook_5_Hybrid.ipynb
    Notebook_6_Evaluation.ipynb
    Notebook_7_Visualization.ipynb

Workflow:
1. Notebook_1: Load Mural512 images, create/save corresponding mask and damaged versions, and copy ground truth into data/ground_truth
2. Notebook_2: Implement PDE-based restoration. Save outputs in methods/PDE/results
3. Notebook_3: Implement Patch-based restoration. Save outputs in methods/Patch/results
4. Notebook_4: Train and test CNN/U-Net-based inpainting. Save outputs in methods/Deep/results
5. Notebook_5: Create hybrid pipeline: PDE output -> CNN refining. Save outputs in methods/Hybrid/results
6. Notebook_6: Compute metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, edge accuracy) by comparing outputs with ground truth and store in results CSV
7. Notebook_7: Generate side-by-side visual comparisons, qualitative analysis, and prepare reports

Key Details:
- Each notebook operates independently and saves results in the corresponding method’s folder.
- Keep consistent naming for inputs and outputs to enable automated evaluation.
- Ensure masks align perfectly with damaged and ground truth images.
- Use synthetic damage masks for controlled experimentation. Real masks can be tested separately in advanced analysis.
